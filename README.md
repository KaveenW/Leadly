# Leadly

Leadly is a lightweight collaborative task manager built for a small lead-generation startup to replace the complexity of tools like Notion.

The goal is to provide a clean, fast, no-fluff experience focused purely on execution.

## Tech Stack

- React + Tailwind (Frontend)
- Node.js + Express (Backend)
- PostgreSQL + Prisma
- Redis + BullMQ (Automations – planned)

## Core Features (Planned)

- Team-based boards & tasks
- Simple workflow (To Do, Doing, Done)
- Task assignment & due dates
- Automations & reminders
- Real-time updates (later)

## Why this project?

This project was inspired by real issues my team faced using heavy tools like Notion. We wanted something simpler, faster, and more focused on getting things done.
